EquiLink: A Semi-Custodial Cross-Chain Bridge
Overview

The rising demand for blockchain interoperability is accelerating advancements in cross-chain bridge technologies, which are crucial for seamless information transfer in multi-blockchain ecosystems.
However, existing blockchain bridges generally fall into two categories:

    Custodial Bridges: Utilize a trusted third party for easier and faster transactions, but rely heavily on custodian trust.

    Non-Custodial Bridges: Rely on smart contracts to enhance transparency and user control, but are often complex and slower.

Currently, no existing design successfully combines the advantages of both models without inheriting their limitations.
What is EquiLink?

EquiLink is a novel semi-custodial cross-chain bridge that blends the benefits of custodial and non-custodial approaches while mitigating their drawbacks.
Key Features

    EquiLink Service: A smart contract that initiates cross-chain transfers.

    EquiLink Network: A decentralized network composed of remote-attested Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), responsible for securely verifying and issuing transfers.

    Open Participation: Any participant equipped with a TEE and remote attestation can join the network and contribute.

    Economic Incentives: Participants are regulated by a staking-based economic model that strengthens security through financial motivation.

System Architecture

EquiLink integrates participants—verified via remote attestation and operating within TEEs—into a decentralized network governed by smart contracts.
The system enables:

    Non-custodial routing

    Staking mechanisms

    Secure cross-chain transaction validation

This architecture improves transparency and user control, while significantly reducing risks associated with both centralized and decentralized designs.
Security and Performance

Through rigorous evaluations, EquiLink demonstrates:

    Resistance to replay and physical attacks

    Reduction in transaction costs by 14.1%

    Reduction in transaction latency by 16.6%

EquiLink offers a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for cross-chain interoperability.
